# What is Clean Chatbox?

A copy-pasta custom HTML, CSS, JS, and Fields package for twitch streamers, particularly those who use Streamlabs to do their twitch chatbox. It uses and builds off of [Pastel Hearts](https://github.com/jhoooooo/streamlabs-chat), and snagging the hearts animation from that project. Please check out the original and send the og developer my regards!

# Usage / Installation

1. Go to Streamlabs, and navigate to the widgets. There should be a chat widget, click on it.
2. Near the bottom, you'll see "Enable Custom HTML/CSS." Click Enable!
3. For each of the tabs that show up underneath the radio buttons, copy and paste each of the files into the respective sections.
4. Note that for the Custom Fields, you have to click "Add" before you can edit as a JSON file and do the copy pasta.
5. Save the changes, and observe the beauty unfold before your eyes!
